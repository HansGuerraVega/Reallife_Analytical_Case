# Project Description
You work for the online store Ice, which sells video games worldwide. User and expert reviews, genres, platforms (e.g., Xbox or PlayStation), and historical data on game sales are available from open sources. You need to identify patterns that determine whether a game is successful or not. This will allow you to identify promising projects and plan advertising campaigns.
The data goes back to 2016. Let's imagine it's December 2016 and you're planning a campaign for 2017.
The dataset contains a "rating" column that stores each game's ESRB rating. The Entertainment Software Rating Board evaluates a game's content and assigns an age rating of either Teen or Mature.

## Instructions for Completing the Project
### Step 1. Visualize the Data

Open the data file and review the general information: games.csv

### Step 2. Prepare the Data

Convert the data to the necessary types.
Describe the columns in which the data types have been changed.
If necessary, choose how to handle missing values.
Pay attention to the abbreviation TBD: it stands for "to be determined."
Calculate the total sales (the sum of sales across all regions) for each game and place these values ​​in a separate column.
Provide your observations.

### Step 3. Analyze the Data

Look at how many games were released in different years.
Observe how sales vary from platform to platform. Choose the platforms with the highest total sales and build a distribution based on each year's data. Look for platforms that used to be popular but are now losing sales.
Determine what period you should collect data for. To do this, look at your answers to the previous questions. The data should allow you to build a model for 2017.
Work only with the data you consider relevant. Ignore data from previous years.
Which platforms are the sales leaders? Which ones are growing and which ones are shrinking? Choose several potentially profitable platforms.
Create a box plot for the global sales of all games, broken down by platform. Describe your findings.
See how user and professional reviews affect sales on a popular platform (your choice). Draw conclusions.
Based on your conclusions, compare sales of the same games on other platforms.
Take a look at the overall distribution of games by genre.

### Step 4. Create a user profile for each region

For each region (NA, EU, JP), determine:

The top five platforms. Describe the variations in their market share from region to region.
The top five genres. Explain the differences.
Whether ESRB ratings affect sales in individual regions.

### Step 5. Test the following hypotheses:

— The average user ratings for the Xbox One and PC platforms are the same.

— The average user ratings for the Action and Sports genres are different.
